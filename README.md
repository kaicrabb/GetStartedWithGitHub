# GetStartedWithGitHub

GitHub is one of the most important tools in Computer Science.

It allows us to effectively collaborate on projects with one another.

It's also a good way for us to showcase our projects/what we've been working on.

When used correctly, it can even help you in interviews/applying for jobs or internships.

### 7. Overlapping changes
  -I'm going to demonstrate what happens if two people try to push changes at the same spot and how we can get around that.

### 8. Using Git
  -Before GitHub, there was a tool called Git that allowed you to commit from the command line.
  -You can download it here: https://git-scm.com/

### 9. Cloning a repo from terminal.
  -I'll show you an example of how to clone this repo from the terminal

### 10. Making changes in terminal
  -Once you've finished making the changes you want to make, git makes it very easy to push these changes up.
  
  <pre> ```bash 
    git add [filename] 
    git commit -m "[commit message]" 
    git push 
  ``` </pre>

  -Following these steps will allow you to push your changes to your repo, and changes will sync with your GitHub repo.
