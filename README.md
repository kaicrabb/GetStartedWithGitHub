# GetStartedWithGitHub

GitHub is one of the most important tools in Computer Science.

It allows us to effectively collaborate on projects with one another.

It's also a good way for us to showcase our projects/what we've been working on.

When used correctly, it can even help you in interviews/applying for jobs or internships.
