# GetStartedWithGitHub

GitHub is one of the most important tools in Computer Science.

It enables us to collaborate effectively on projects with one another.

It's also a good way for us to showcase our projects/what we've been working on.

When used correctly, it can even help you in interviews/applying for jobs, or internships.
I highly suggest this repo to practice coding with project-based learning: https://github.com/The-Cool-Coders/Project-Ideas-And-Resources?tab=readme-ov-file

### 1. Setting up GitHub Account (Use personal email)
  -Use this link: https://github.com/signup

---

### 2. Download GitHub Desktop (makes for quick and easy commits to your repo)
   -Use this link: https://desktop.github.com/download/

---

### 3. GitHub Terminology
  -Use this website to learn the basic things you can do in GitHub: https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_intro.asp?remote=github

---

### 4. Cloning a Repository
  -Clone this repo and make your own copy of this repository in GitHub Desktop

---

### 5. Making a Change to the Files
  -Make a change to the file and push the changes back using GitHub Desktop

---

### 6. Pull Changes I Made
  -I'm going to make a change to the files in this repo, and I want you to pull the changes

---

### 7. Overlapping Changes
  -I'm going to demonstrate what happens if two people try to push changes at the same spot and how we can get around that.

---

### 8. Using Git
  -Before GitHub, there was a tool called Git that allowed you to commit from the command line.
  -You can download it here: https://git-scm.com/

---

### 9. Cloning a Repo from Terminal.
  -I'll show you an example of how to clone this repo from the terminal (will have to have SSH keys to perform this step)

---

### 10. Making Changes in Terminal
  -Once you've finished making the changes you want to make, git makes it very easy to push these changes up.
  
  ```bash 
    git add [filename] 
    git commit -m "[commit message]" 
    git push 
  ```

  -Following these steps will allow you to push your changes to your repo, and the changes will sync with your GitHub repo.

---

### 11. GitHub Pages
  -You can even deploy your web-based repos to GitHub Pages for free if it's a public repository!
  This is what I did with our Bug Hunt website from last meeting: https://kaicrabb.github.io/debug-quest/
